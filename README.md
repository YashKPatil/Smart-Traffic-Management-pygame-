Smart Traffic Management System (Pygame) 🚦


Overview
This project is a traffic simulation system built using Pygame, designed to dynamically manage traffic signals based on real-time traffic density. It utilizes AI-based techniques to optimize traffic flow, reduce congestion, and prioritize emergency vehicles.

Features
✅ Traffic Signal Control – Dynamic adjustment of traffic lights based on vehicle density.
✅ Emergency Vehicle Priority – Gives priority to ambulances and emergency vehicles.
✅ Accident Detection – Simulates accident scenarios and reroutes traffic accordingly.
✅ Multi-Lane Simulation – Supports multiple roads and intersections.
✅ Real-Time Animation – Smooth visual representation using Pygame.
